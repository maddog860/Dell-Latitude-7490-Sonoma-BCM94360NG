Dell Latitude 7490 OpenCore Configuration  Best Experienced With: Mac OS Sonoma



First and foremost, this project wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this github project:
https://github.com/CloverLeafBG/Dell-Latitude-7490-OC-Hackintosh
This project builds on the previous author’s work, and has been adapted to work with Mac OS Sonoma. AI helped quite a bit as well, figured I would mention it.




The following boot arguments are all that is needed for me, your experience may vary: 
alcid=13 watchdog=0 brcmfx-delay=300
To use DEBUG AirportBrcmFixup.kext add these boot-args: -brcmfxdbg -liludbgall

 System Configuration
•	CPU: Intel Core i7-8650U
•	iGPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620
•	RAM: 32GB DDR4 2400Mhz
•	SSD: WD Blue SN5000 2TB
•	WiFi: BCM94360NG
•	Display: 1920*1080 FullHD IPS
•	Sound Card: Realtek ALC256
•	LAN: Intel I219-LM
•	Touchpad: Alps touchpad


BCM94360NG NSS:1 fix (AirportBrcmFixup.kext v. 2.1.9 mod)
This is probably the most meaningful contribution. The BCM94360NG problem was that on a cold macOS boot, the Broadcom driver applied a single-transmit-chain constraint, leaving the card at NSS:1 instead of NSS:2.
The fix was found by comparing the good NSS:2 state with the bad NSS:1 state (good state initiated by booting into Windows first), then instrumenting and reverse-engineering Apple’s Broadcom driver. That led to the internal function _wlc_stf_txchain_set. Then discovered that it takes four arguments, and logging showed the bad path was specifically setting: 
constraint/reason 2 to a chain value of 0x1, whereas the working state used 0x3.
The custom AirportBrcmFixup patch hooks that function and changes only that specific bad case: 
reason == 2 && txchain == 1 → change the chain mask to 0x3  Then it lets Apple’s original function continue normally. So the fix doesn't artificially report NSS:2 or generally force Wi-Fi settings. It prevents Apple’s driver from incorrectly disabling the second transmit chain in that one situation. 
The result is that the BCM94360NG comes up with both TX chains enabled and maintains NSS:2 without needing the Windows-boot workaround.

Note: For MacOS Sonoma you must use OpenCore Legacy Patcher in order to get BCM94360NG card functioning, as Sonoma removed driver support for this card. Latest version was used successfully.

Sleep fix for AlpsHID.kext
My particular Latitude was failing to fall asleep because the cursor would keep moving slightly, as soon as the lid was closed, thus preventing sleep from occurring. The modified AlpsHID.kext specifically disables cursor input once lid is closed, and resumes functioning when lid is opened again. Using this kext there has been no issue with falling asleep. Previously it was recommended to disable USB PowerShare and USB Wake Support to overcome this specific issue, and it may not be needed anymore if your trackpad can use this kext.
